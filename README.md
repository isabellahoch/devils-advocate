# The Devils' Advocate

The Devils' Advocate is the student-run newspaper of San Francisco University High School. As technical developer for the DA, I created a Flask-backed website to allow impactful student work to reach a greater audience as well as give editors a simpler way to aggregate and organize articles and newspaper information.

## How to Access
The DA website is currently hosted on Heroku. Please visit [da.sfuhs.org](http://da.sfuhs.org)â€”you can use the credentials *test@sfuhs.org* and *sfuhsda* to access.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Locally

```bash
cd flask
python main.py
```
