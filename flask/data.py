	"contents":"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your head has been anywhere near the entertainment industry within the past few months, you most likely would have heard of the extremely popular Korean film, <span style='font-style:italic'>Parasite</span>. Having been nominated for numerous awards including at the upcoming Oscars (update: It won Best Picture!) and having won numerous awards such as Best Foreign Language Film at the 2020 Golden Globe Awards, this movie is definitely one you shouldn’t miss out on. The endless action as well as unexpected twists keep you at the edge of your seat. In addition, the social message and articulate imagery throughout the film are very compelling and relevant to today's society.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directed by the talented Bong Joon-Ho, this film sucks the viewer into the world of the low-class Kim family living in the suburbs of Korea. Living in a semi-basement house and folding pizza boxes for money, this movie highlights their struggle for success. They soon meet the wealthy Park family and attempt to take advantage of them in order to raise their own socioeconomic status. Throughout the story’s timeline, many secrets are revealed as both families are oblivious to each other’s motives. As David Edelstein from <span style='font-style:italic'>Vulture</span> said, “What keeps you rapt in Parasite is the visual wit — every shot distills the movie’s themes — and the richness of the characters and performances.” Each frame is meticulously crafted to make this movie a pleasant masterpiece.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I would recommend going into the movie with no expectations. Therefore, you can experience the story unfolding before your eyes, without any preconceived notions. Also, don’t let the fact that this film is in Korean deter you. As Bong Joon-Ho said in his Golden Globes acceptance speech, “Once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.” Furthermore, I would recommend watching the film twice because of all the easter eggs and hidden messages. Watching a second time will definitely give you many “ah-ha” moments of references you didn’t catch the first time. One piece of advice I would give is to pay close attention to detail and symbolism when watching, not only to the images and objects in the film, but also to how the camerawork is done. This will reveal a lot about the underlying critique of social class in today’s society. Don’t worry, if you still don’t get some of the references, there are always many YouTube videos explaining the movies. Just don’t go down a rabbit-hole of Parasite explanation videos.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you haven’t seen Parasite yet, hurry, before it leaves theaters. I can guarantee you will enjoy it!"

	"contents":"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been over a month since the 54th Super Bowl, in which the Kansas City Chiefs won their first Super Bowl in 50 years. The Chiefs, however, are part of a group of professional sports teams who continue to receive backlash for their cultural appropriation of Native American’s through their team name, logo, traditions, and fans. Some other teams that also fall in this group are the Washington Redskins, the Atlanta Braves, and the Cleveland Indians to name a few. While the racist names and logos of these teams often receive deserved attention, the actions of fans of these organization can often be overlooked. Aside from wearing offensive headdresses and face paint, fans for many of these teams participate in the well-known tomahawk chant. While I had seen many teams’ fans do this chant, I admittedly did not know the origin of the chant, but was able to get some facts with a little research.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tomahawk chop chant is said to have originated from Florida State University, whose mascot is the Seminole. A former Florida State University president once claimed that the chant originated from the school’s marching band in the 1980s. For a while, the mascot for the school was “Seminole Sammy,” a white student dressed up in fake, stereotypical Native American dress. The chant is also said to have been brought to professional sports by Deion Sanders, a football hall of famer. However, he first brought the chant to baseball in the 1990s, when he was a member of the Atlanta Braves, a team that currently has a tomahawk in their logo. According to multiple sources, there is no indication that Native Americans ever made the tomahawk chant gesture, but rather that it was made up by white people appropriating their culture.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another note, the tomahawk chop has not only been restricted to sports. For example, in 2012, members of Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown’s staffers were caught on video using the chant to mock his then opponent, and current presidential candidate, Elizabeth Warren’s, Native American ancestry.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tomahawk chant is just another example of a way that Native American culture is incorrectly represented and used by others in America. Many fans who participate in this chant at games probably have no knowledge of the history of the chant or even an accurate history of Native Americans. Like the creator of this chant, many of these fans are non-native. As previously mentioned, the names, logos, and even mascots of teams like the Chiefs can overshadow offensive fan behavior."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like every UHS student remembers the first time they entered the Student Center. I’ll never forget walking in and being immediately thrown to the corner by two seniors cutting the line. I skipped lunch that day, like most anxious freshmen. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most shadows never see the Student Center, which I find funny considering it’s theoretically the center of student life if you attend here. But we keep shadows away from the Stuce during lunch, tucking them away in JSL with chips, soda, sandwiches, and cookies, a combination of food that would probably take at least 15 minutes to get in the Student Center. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last year, Pia Tate (‘19) and Lily Battat (‘19) did their Senior Project on Eating Disorders at UHS. The project consisted of surveys, student interviews, action items for UHS, as well as their own personal reflections. When describing their survey, they said, “many students mentioned experiencing an intense feeling of anxiety when entering the Student Center, due to the way students talk about food and their own bodies as well as the lack of options present in the Student Center. Many students classified the hot lunch meals as traditionally ‘heavy’ or ‘unhealthy’ while saying the grab and go salads were often wimpy and extremely low calorie. Therefore, the lack of range in healthy options contributes to a common practice of skipping lunch or feeling intense fear when confronted with the only option of perceived unhealthy hot meals.” They also quoted a specific survey response: “I think that I would have likely consumed more calories if UHS had provided options that my eating disordered brain thought of as ‘healthy’ or ‘safe.’ When I was tired of having the exact same salad from the grab-and-go fridge every day, I would simply not eat lunch. Even now, having recovered from my eating disorder, there are still a lot of days at school where I have to make the choice between eating something unhealthy but filling or eating a pretty wimpy salad that will certainly leave me hungry. I think everybody, regardless of their relationship to eating, would benefit from a wider variety of (and more filling) healthy options in the Student Center.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A student said the following in an anonymous interview: “It is well-known that the food in the Student Center is widely complained about, with students and faculty members alike describing it as ‘gross’, ‘heavy’, and ‘unhealthy.’ This opinion of UHS food prompted me to overanalyze my eating habits, and it made it harder for me to order and eat it without feeling guilt or insecurity.” Another anonymous student said “UHS lunches, in general, have a huge impact on disordered eating habits between myself and friends. The unhealthy options in comparison to the low-calorie salads create an environment in which it feels okay to skip lunch, which creates an unhealthy habit that has the ability to spiral into something dangerous.” 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know it feels like you may be reading the same phrases over and over: “wimpy salads,” “heavy,” “skip lunch,” the list goes on. These themes are incredibly important and are exactly what we need to work on! 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Body Positive Club recently had a meeting on the Student Center to discuss ways we could improve food options and eating dynamics in general. The majority of our meeting was filled with freshmen girls who had only been a part of the UHS community for a few months, yet they had endless things to say about the Stuce. The most common criticism was the lack of healthy snacks. Many mentioned wanting things like carrots and hummus, edamame, almonds, and more fruit. A senior said a similar thing, “I used to love when there was almond butter and stuff in the Stuce, but now I feel like I can only get chips or muffins and they make me feel like crap so I just end up not eating when I feel like I need fuel.” 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make it super clear that this has nothing to do with the absolutely amazing people that work in the Kitchen of the Stuce. They are making 400+ people delicious food in a very small space every day. They are amazing! This is about UHS’ priorities and resources. How is it possible that other independent schools, with similar tuition costs and space constraints have much more efficient and healthy cafeterias?  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UHS should have the resources to improve our food options. It may require changes in budget or reallocation of funds, but the resources are there if the priorities are realigned. There are too many people in this community suffering from disordered eating and eating disorders that the Stuce undeniably plays a role in. I know we can find solutions because we are an incredible (and very expensive) academic institution filled with smart people who are good at solving problems. Imagine a world where we don’t hide our shadows from the Stuce but are actually proud of our cafeteria! Imagine a world where we didn’t tell freshmen to bring lunch for the first two weeks to avoid the Student Center mess. Imagine a world where the Student Center was an environment where all people, whether they have never struggled with disordered eating or they’ve had anorexia for years, feel comfortable and safe to fuel themselves.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a world so evolved, it isn’t difficult to get used to everyday things that come easy for many people. A light will turn on at the flick of a switch and a stream of water will flow at the twist of a tap, but what if these seemingly normal things were to one day disappear? What if the earth found itself with a depletion of resources to sustain humanity? Decades ago these questions would have been looked at as crazy, but right now, the future holds many doubts and unanswered questions, with climate change being at the root of many of them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alarm surrounding climate change has heightened over recent years, and even more so with devastating events like the Australian wildfires occurring across the globe. Climate scientists have declared that humans only have 12 years to reverse the effects of climate change before the Earth falls into permanent, unrepairable deterioration. Although this is a startling revelation, the amount of people unfazed by this is just as baffling. Many people either don’t see the truth in this shocking declaration, like out President Donald Trump, and therefore choose to ignore it, or they expect someone else to take initiative and fix the problem for them. The problem with this is that the efforts of only a few people who care, won’t be enough to create significant change to fix the climate crisis. The environmental crisis is a culmination of the decisions that people have made for hundreds of years, and in order to fix it in the little time we have, everyone needs to take some part, no matter how big or small. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although people will understandably find themselves engrossed in their own lives and futures, we should also be conscious of the future of the world, because the state of the environment in later years determines how (and if ) we can bring out the futures we desire. Some may declare that their concerns only lie with themselves, but the irony is that saving ourselves requires the saving of the earth that we live on. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of now, there is only one planet with the resources to support human life. Earth is truly one of a kind, and a lack of action now may be the contributing factor to the loss of our home in the future. But climate change doesn’t have to be the downfall of humanity. As young students, we often don’t have the same opportunities as adults do to directly create change in the system, but little things do go a long way, and whether that means voting for better leaders or attending the next climate march, the future will stand a better chance with your action.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was 7 PM Monday evening, the night of the Iowa Caucus, and I was volunteering at the West Des Moines Democratic caucus at Drake University. Each precinct would have one winner, selected after two rounds. Voters were asked to sit in sections based on their preferred candidate. In 40 minutes, we would have the winner of our location and then by 8:30 or 9 PM at the latest, we should have the state totals and know who won Iowa. As many of you know by now, it wasn’t that simple.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly an hour later, I could not help noticing how excruciatingly long it was taking for officials to count first-round votes. From the volunteer area, I could easily see how many registered voters were organized neatly in gym seats in the Bernie section versus rows of Buttigieg voters, and so on. If I could do a quick headcount, why was it taking staffers so long? The second round looked to be even messier. What was going on?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iowa caucuses is called the “first in the nation'' and since 1972, has been one of the most important steps in deciding who wins the general election. Caucuses are entirely different from primaries, which are done by voting privately in booths and are run by the state. In contrast, caucuses are run partly by the state and are lively community events where neighbors openly show their preferences and convince undecideds to join them. As a registered observer, I could witness these debates up close.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A candidate must receive 15% support in the first round of all precinct voters present to be eligible in the second round.  If a candidate receives under 15%, his or her supporters switch to another viable candidate in the second round. Finally, the number of delegates - or State Delegate Equivalents awarded is calculated through a formula. These results are then reported to the public. Confusing, right?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My goal for this trip was to see democracy in action. My dad and I flew into Des Moines a few days before and attended nine back-to-back events, seeing Steyer, Sanders, Yang, Warren, Buttigieg, and Biden. Held in places like a local pizza parlor, a huge Mexican restaurant, or university lecture halls, these events are free, open to the public and extraordinarily low key. Getting a selfie with Andrew, high-fives from a sprinting Elizabeth and “How’s UHS?” from Tom (okay, I admit I shouted “SFUHS!” when he was close by), I enjoyed the proximity. This felt like a county fair and very different to how candidates typically campaign in California with $25,000-a-plate dinners.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s why the Iowa caucuses are special. They were talking to us, not the cameras, moderators, or the press. Buttigieg's ability to connect with individuals in the crowd and Yang’s humor made each of their stump speeches sound more convincing. You could feel it was personal.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mess at our precinct continued and by 9:30 pm, most were restless. The early polls showed Bernie to be the likely winner, so along with news teams from around the world, we left the comfort of the Drake gym and crammed into the dated Holiday Inn ballroom for the Bernie victory event, hoping to catch history in the making.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hours later, exhausted from standing, we still had no results. CNN was reporting issues with an app, a hack by Russians, or the DNC preventing Bernie from winning. At 10:40 pm, Bernie staffers shuffled attendees, including my dad and I, onto the bleachers behind the podium and gave us Bernie signs to wave. Then, suddenly, Bernie entered and made a hastily-modified victory speech of under ten minutes. Sanders’ speech reflected confidence that he would win but cast a tangible uneasiness in the room. We weren’t allowed off the stage for another 90 minutes in case results came in. Around midnight, half out of exhaustion and half out of desperation, we jumped off and left. We still did not know who won, but it was an amazing, albeit unexpected, end.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Monday night, Des Moines was bustling with visitors and media. By Tuesday, the city was more like a ghost town, its streets empty and restaurants and cafes back to serving the regulars. Historically, for Democrats, the Iowa caucus winner has frequently become the Democratic nominee. In this race, there is no telling because there was no real winner. After months of campaigning and an extremely unsatisfying night, attention had now turned towards the next contest of this presidential season: New Hampshire.

articles.append({"title":"The Lunch Line",
	"section":"Op-Ed",
	"edition":"february-2020",
	"author":"arthur-serra",
	"contents":"""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UHS is impacted by a terrible and unjust practice every single day, a menace that is far worse than the paper straw epidemic. The magnitude and scale are akin to the daily sightings of sophomores studying for Civ. This system of inequity between the haves and have-nots is taken advantage of by all parts of our community. The lunch line might be University High School’s Achilles heel. It is, of course, not the fault of George and his team of incredible people that prepare and serve over 400 meals a day for the student body, faculty, and staff that this problem exists, but rather that of the administration. The way that the lunch line is set up has some inherent flaws that from my perspective seem to be perennially talked about but never actually changed. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat down with Julia Eels to learn more about this issue and ask what the school was going to do to make it easier for everybody to get their lunch, eat it, and use the period the way it is supposed to be used. It should be a break from learning and to recharge our batteries, but due to the inefficiency and fundamental issues with the line, cannot be used as it should be. The administration has seen and understands the problem that is facing us all but has not yet addressed it. Although it is significantly hindered by the conditional use policy affecting the kitchen tools that we can have and use at UHS, the school has not informed us of any plans that they have.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they have not informed us, it falls upon me to do so. The school has major plans to be put in motion this summer during renovations of the school. The main purpose of the renovation is to increase classroom size, but the school has seen this as an opportunity to fix this problem and to give George and his team an easier time as well as giving us all more time to eat our lunch. Improvements include the institution of a preorder system for the customs meals, allowing those special people who need avocado in their quesadilla to get it, without creating a massive line to get food. The creation of a second line for grab-and-go is another plan, specifically around sandwiches, yogurts, and drinks. Moreover, the addition of a second register has also been proposed. Many of these changes have been talked about and debated with a “Lunch Line Consultant,” as Julia calls them, an individual the school has hired to help create a better environment for the entire community. Whether this was a useful choice is yet to be determined. The most interesting is the idea to add a “healthy, lunch, snacky” vending option in South to hopefully allow lunches to be eaten across campuses. In this writer’s opinion, this should significantly improve the fire hazard that is our lunch line. We can all remember a time getting stuck in the maelstrom that is the space between getting your lunch and paying for it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the interview, Julia stressed many times several things, including how grateful Julia is to George and his team, a similar sentiment that is undoubtedly felt by the rest of the student body. Moreover, in the coming year, everybody should preorder their lunch as much as possible so that the student center will have less body traffic allowing for the fastest possible lunch line. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these things that will be added to our community in the coming year are part of a greater master plan that is built around adding more lunch and social places throughout the four campuses to not make us all end up in one small place. Hopefully, all these things will come to pass, and we’ll soon have a better lunch line.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, adults telling us bullying is bad will not stop it—we need to fix it ourselves.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bullying affected my middle school experience a lot, where kids would regularly hate on other kids, ruining their day, their week, and their individuality along with it. Although teachers realized this was happening, their bombardment of anti-bullying campaigns did next to nothing. Their good intentions and advice bounced off our class as if they had never been there. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that they didn’t try, it’s that their methods weren’t effective. No teenager is going to listen to a middle-aged adult lecture them on how to accept everyone and be selfless when that same adult is completely oblivious to the actual reality of the situation. In addition to that, parents and teachers aren’t relatable. During the MLK day symposium, the keynote speaker was easier to connect with as he was close in age to us, giving us more reason to hear what he was saying.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked up ‘How to stop bullying’ recently, and I found that most of the “help” was not helpful at all. As someone who has experienced bullying firsthand, I can say that teachers' interference will only halt the bullying for the moment, not indefinitely end the problem. The bullies will not suddenly realize that what they are doing is wrong and start weeping at their feet, praying for forgiveness. What needs to be done must be a gradual thing, an entire societal change of teaching people to love. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very little that is happening now is truly going to stop bullying. Sure, adults may attempt to do the right thing, but in the end, it is up to the kids. We need to have empathy. We need to understand the actual effect of our statements and how what you may think is a joke is not just a joke. The National Education Association says, “Different students have different levels of coping; what may be considered teasing to one may be humiliating and devastating to another.” Still, though this is accurate, in all the pages I read, none said anything on how to stop the problem as a bystander seeing another classmate doing it. Once again, that bully who made fun of you for expressing your feelings will not be searching the internet for how to be a better person.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few ideas on how to begin to end this problem and I know that something needs to happen, which needs to start with us students. Although it may seem small, that one time when you show restraint instead of snapping back could make someone’s day enormously better. We are the problem, but that means we can also be the solution. So which are you?
